# zoom_recorder

zoom recorder will join a zoom meeting (like a lecture) for you and record it  
zoom recorder uses crontab to schedule when the program runs  
the images in the repo are used by the python script to locate buttons on the screen to press  
these images are from zoom on ubuntu, so you will likely need to use images from
your machine due to varying style and color.
